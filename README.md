# Hi, I am Tom 🖐🏼

It is nice to see you here!<br>
I am currently studying information science at Ca' Foscari University, in Venice.

My main languages are `C++, C#, Rust, Go and TypeScript`, but I also have experience with `C, Java, JavaScript and Dart`.

I enjoy building high-performance distributed applications and working with realtime technologies such as `WebRTC`.

## Other 🎛

* I've been producing music since I was 11 years old, and still it is my favourite hobby.
* I only talk to people who follow [Google's C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).
