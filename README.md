# Hi, I am Tom. 🖐🏼

It is nice to see you here!<br>
I am currently studying information technology at Ca' Foscari University, in Venice.

My main languages are `C++, C, C#, Go, TypeScript and Dart`, but I also have experience with `JavaScript, Java and Rust`.


## Extra

My favourite hobby is music production, and I have been making music for over 8 years.
