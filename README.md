# Hi, I am Tom 🖐🏼

It is nice to see you here!<br>
I am currently studying information science at Ca' Foscari University of Venice.

My main programming languages are <kbd>🦀 Rust</kbd> <kbd>C++</kbd> <kbd>C#</kbd> <kbd>Go</kbd>,
but I also have experience with <kbd>C</kbd> <kbd>Java</kbd> <kbd>JavaScript/TypeScript</kbd> and <kbd>Dart</kbd>

I enjoy building high-performance software and working with realtime media technologies.


## Other 🎛

* I've been producing music since I was 11 years old, and still it is my favourite hobby.
